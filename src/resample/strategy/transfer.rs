//! RFC #238 — caller-configurable opto-electronic transfer functions for
//! the [`AveragingDomain::Linear`](super::AveragingDomain::Linear) domain.
//!
//! The Linear domain averages an area downscale in *linear light*: each
//! source pixel is decoded to RGB, the inverse transfer function (EOTF)
//! lifts the gamma-encoded RGB to linear light, the linear samples are
//! box-averaged, and the forward transfer function (OETF) re-encodes the
//! result. A [`TransferFunction`] is the EOTF/OETF pair that brackets that
//! average; the two are exact analytic inverses, so a decode→re-encode
//! round-trip with no averaging is (modulo float rounding) the identity.
//!
//! In this release the Linear tail decodes through the production
//! `yuv_*_to_rgb_row` kernels, which clamp + quantize to 8-bit `[0, 255]`
//! before the EOTF — so the average is **display-referred**: it mixes the
//! converted in-gamut 8-bit RGB in linear light (a gamma-correct resize),
//! not a scene-linear average of the unclamped affine decode. The curves
//! here are written to also cover the unclamped (out-of-`[0, 1]`) case a
//! future scene-linear consumer will feed; see the EOTF/OETF extrapolation
//! notes and the `sinker::mixed::linear_light` module header.
//!
//! # Why this exists separately from the matrix
//!
//! pixon's [`ColorMatrix`] (the mediaframe `Matrix`) is an H.273
//! *MatrixCoefficients* value — it fixes the YCbCr→RGB matrix, not the
//! transfer characteristics. The transfer (H.273 *TransferCharacteristics*)
//! is an independent axis pixon's YUV row stage does not carry, because
//! the convert is purely affine. The Linear domain is the first consumer
//! that needs it, so this module supplies the curves and a per-matrix
//! [default resolution](TransferFunction::for_matrix).
//!
//! # The per-`ColorMatrix` default
//!
//! When the caller selects the Linear domain without an explicit override,
//! the transfer is resolved from the sink's [`ColorMatrix`] by the
//! established colorimetric convention:
//!
//! - The [`ColorMatrix::Rgb`] identity (sRGB / ST 428-1 primaries) resolves
//!   to [`TransferFunction::Srgb`] — the matching sRGB curve.
//! - Every YCbCr video matrix (BT.601 / BT.709 / BT.2020 / SMPTE-170M /
//!   240M / FCC / BT.470BG / YCgCo / …) resolves to
//!   [`TransferFunction::Bt1886`] — the ITU-R BT.1886 reference *display*
//!   EOTF (pure 2.4 gamma) that SDR video is mastered against, regardless
//!   of which matrix coefficients carry the chroma. This is the standard
//!   video convention: the matrix selects the YCbCr basis, the BT.1886
//!   display curve selects how the encoded RGB maps to light.
//!
//! Callers who carry a known transfer out of band override it explicitly
//! with [`MixedSinker::with_transfer_function`](crate::sinker::MixedSinker::with_transfer_function).
//!
//! [`ColorMatrix`]: crate::ColorMatrix
